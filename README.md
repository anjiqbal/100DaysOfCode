# 100 Days Of Code / School of Code Bootcamp 14.0 Diary

## Day 13 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp


_Monday 13th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about computational thinking and problem solving as key skills - just as important (if not more!) than knowing how to code.
- I learnt about agile ways of developing and the importance of early feedback.
- I spent some time at then end of the day going over today's notesas well as anki review.
- Completed a codewars challenge.

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code
My codewars challenge was to search an array for smiley faces and return a count. As time was an issue, I hardcoded the passable smiley faces in. Given more time, I would have coded a more modular solution where it would be easy to make changes.

#### School of Code
I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of cohort 14 with The School of Code. I plan on making the absolute most of it and doing everything I can to be successful. A massive part of that will be ensuring I manage my time effectively and remembering that it is a marathon not a sprint. I can't wait to see what the rest of the bootcamp and 100 days of code bring.

## Day 14 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp


_Tuesday 14th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt more about computational thinking - decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithms.
- I worked on a login and more or less game with my pair programming partner in scratch. 
- I applied the concepts we learnt and a more systematic approach to my codewars challenge in the evening. 

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code
The more rigorous, systematic way of breaking down the codewars problem was really useful. I struggled at first but once I began, it became easier. The pseudocode I ended up writing was really helpful when I eventually went to code the solution.

#### School of Code
I'm enjoying working with my partner for the week, Bernard Molyneux. The process of sharing ideas and articulating my thoughts has already been incredibly valuable to me and I feel myself gaining confidence. 
The approach to problem solving and making sure you really understand what it is that you are trying to solve is surprisingly challenging but is obviously very neccessary. I realise now that while I thought I had a systematic approach to finding solutions, actually I was still rushing in to code

## Day 15 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 15th March_

### Today's progress:

- Started learning JavaScript with SoC today. As I have covered these topics in my personal learning prior to the bootcamp, it served as useful refresher. 
- I got more familiar with Git and GitHub today. 
- Working as part of a team is getting easier, still some technical challenges to overcome, mainly related to GitHub

### Thoughts:

Covered variables, loops and functions today with SoC which was a good reminder of the foundations. I found talking a team member through a workshop activity especially useful as it made me slow down, really think about what was required and then articulate that in a way that was understandable.
Today's Codewars challenge was something I had come across before so I was able to apply that previous knowledge to today's problem.

## Day 16 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 16th March_

### Today's progress:

- Revised objects, creating objects and accessing properties using dot notation and square brackets
- Revised arrays, creating arrays, nested arrays, arrays of objects and looping over arrays 
- Used git and github to successfully share files with my partner and worl collaboratively to complete the tasks assigned in the workshop. We has some time leftover so we played around with some array methods

### Thoughts:

SoC morning session covered the importance of giving and receiving feedback and how valubable it is for growth. I found this session interesting as it made me think about how I give feedback and reminded me that the goal is not to expect someone to change. It also reminded me that receiving feedback is an opportunity for growth.

Today's codewars kata was on the topic of manipulating a number using array methods to expand it e.g. 306 -> '300 + 6'
My first approach did not work as expected as I used the array method map() which was not skipping over the zeroes as I expected but instead 
returning undefined. I then used to filter() to remove the zeroes but this also presented a probelem as the index was important because of place value.

I then realised I was over thinking this problem and realised I could use a simple forEach to skip over the zeroes and push the manipulated number to another array

## Day 17 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 17th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about clean coding from my mentor - code should read like a story and be understandable for others. I also learnt about 'failing first' which is a way of adding test conditions in your function that eliminate pointless running of code.
- Participated in a hackathon where we pair programmed a game of rock, paper scissors.
- We presented our project and code to other teams and talked them through our thinking and steps.

### Thoughts:

Today's mentor meeting was incredibly informative. I learnt a lot about how to go about breaking problems down and making plans, and what that means in a practical sense. It means that other people can read your code and undrestand what it is that you are doing and what it is that you are trying to do. This is especially important within teams where people can move from project to project multiple times - even in one day.

The hackathon involved creating a game of rock paper scissors. We managed to complete most of it. The key lesson I learnt was on collaborating with others and working together throught making a plan, pair programming and sharing via GitHub.

## Day 18 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 18th March_

### Today's progress:

- Applied what I learnt about problem solving over the past week to solve a level 5 Codewars kata. 
- Did some reading around ChatGPT and the best way to use this tool.
- Forked project hackathon repo and refactored the code

### Thoughts:

As I had more time today I decided to attempt a level 5 kata and appproach it in the way that SoC have taught over the past week. I made a thorough plan and broke each section down. When unsure I put in what I thought a possible appraoch may be. I found that breaking everything down in such detail made the parts I understood far more straightforward to code. With the parts that I didn't understand, it was easy to see what I needed to search for.

I also worked on refactoring the code from the hackathon yesterday. A really useful task as I looked for patterns and was able to tidy up the code. I made sure each action was done by one function and created a function that controlled the game.
