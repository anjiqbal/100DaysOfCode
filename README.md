# 100 Days Of Code / School of Code Bootcamp 14.0 Diary

## Day 13 of 100 Days Of Code
## Day 01 School of Code Bootcamp


_13th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about computational thinking and problem solving as key skills - just as important (if not more!) than knowing how to code.
- I learnt about agile ways of developing and the importance of early feedback.
- I spent some time at then end of the day going over today's notesas well as anki review.
- Completed a codewars challenge.

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code
My codewars challenge was to search an array for smiley faces and return a count. As time was an issue, I hardcoded the passable smiley faces in. Given more time, I would have coded a more modular solution where it would be easy to make changes.

#### School of Code
I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of cohort 14 with The School of Code. I plan on making the absolute most of it and doing everything I can to be successful. A massive part of that will be ensuring I manage my time effectively and remembering that it is a marathon not a sprint. I can't wait to see what the rest of the bootcamp and 100 days of code bring.

## Day 14 of 100 Days Of Code
## Day 02 School of Code Bootcamp


_14th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt more about computational thinking - decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithms.
- I worked on a login and more or less game with my pair programming partner in scratch. 
- I applied the concepts we learnt and a more systematic approach to my codewars challenge in the evening. 

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code
The more rigorous, systematic way of breaking down the codewars problem was really useful. I struggled at first but once I began, it became easier. The pseudocode I ended up writing was really helpful when I eventually went to code the solution.

#### School of Code
I'm enjoying working with my partner for the week, Bernard Molyneux. The process of sharing ideas and articulating my thoughts has already been incredibly valuable to me and I feel myself gaining confidence. 
The approach to problem solving and making sure you really understand what it is that you are trying to solve is surprisingly challenging but is obviously very neccessary. I realise now that while I thought I had a systematic approach to finding solutions, actually I was still rushing in to code

## Day 02 School of Code Bootcamp

_15th March_

### Today's progress:

- Started learning JavaScript with SoC today. As I have covered these topics in my personal learning prior to the bootcamp, it served as useful refresher. 
- I got more familiar with Git and GitHub today. 
- Working as part of a team is getting easier, still some technical challenges to overcome, mainly related to GitHub

### Thoughts:

Covered variables, loops and functions today with SoC which was a good reminder of the foundations. I found talking a team member through a workshop activity especially useful as it made me slow down, really think about what was required and then articulate that in a way that was understandable.
Today's Codewars challenge was something I had come across before so I was able to apply that previous knowledge to today's problem.
