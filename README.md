# 100 Days Of Code / School of Code Bootcamp 14.0 Diary

## Day 13 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 13th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about computational thinking and problem solving as key skills - just as important (if not more!) than knowing how to code.
- I learnt about agile ways of developing and the importance of early feedback.
- I spent some time at then end of the day going over today's notes as well as anki review.
- Completed a codewars challenge.

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code

My codewars challenge was to search an array for smiley faces and return a count. As time was an issue, I hardcoded the passable smiley faces in. Given more time, I would have coded a more modular solution where it would be easy to make changes.

#### School of Code

I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of cohort 14 with The School of Code. I plan on making the absolute most of it and doing everything I can to be successful. A massive part of that will be ensuring I manage my time effectively and remembering that it is a marathon not a sprint. I can't wait to see what the rest of the bootcamp and 100 days of code bring.

## Day 14 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 14th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt more about computational thinking - decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithms.
- I worked on a login and more or less game with my pair programming partner in scratch.
- I applied the concepts we learnt and a more systematic approach to my codewars challenge in the evening.

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code

The more rigorous, systematic way of breaking down the codewars problem was really useful. I struggled at first but once I began, it became easier. The pseudocode I ended up writing was really helpful when I eventually went to code the solution.

#### School of Code

I'm enjoying working with my partner for the week, Bernard Molyneux. The process of sharing ideas and articulating my thoughts has already been incredibly valuable to me and I feel myself gaining confidence.
The approach to problem solving and making sure you really understand what it is that you are trying to solve is surprisingly challenging but is obviously very necessary. I realise now that while I thought I had a systematic approach to finding solutions, actually I was still rushing in to code

## Day 15 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 15th March_

### Today's progress:

- Started learning JavaScript with SoC today. As I have covered these topics in my personal learning prior to the bootcamp, it served as useful refresher.
- I got more familiar with Git and GitHub today.
- Working as part of a team is getting easier, still some technical challenges to overcome, mainly related to GitHub

### Thoughts:

Covered variables, loops and functions today with SoC which was a good reminder of the foundations. I found talking a team member through a workshop activity especially useful as it made me slow down, really think about what was required and then articulate that in a way that was understandable.
Today's Codewars challenge was something I had come across before so I was able to apply that previous knowledge to today's problem.

## Day 16 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 16th March_

### Today's progress:

- Revised objects, creating objects and accessing properties using dot notation and square brackets
- Revised arrays, creating arrays, nested arrays, arrays of objects and looping over arrays
- Used git and github to successfully share files with my partner and work collaboratively to complete the tasks assigned in the workshop. We has some time leftover so we played around with some array methods

### Thoughts:

SoC morning session covered the importance of giving and receiving feedback and how valuable it is for growth. I found this session interesting as it made me think about how I give feedback and reminded me that the goal is not to expect someone to change. It also reminded me that receiving feedback is an opportunity for growth.

Today's codewars kata was on the topic of manipulating a number using array methods to expand it e.g. 306 -> '300 + 6'
My first approach did not work as expected as I used the array method map() which was not skipping over the zeroes as I expected but instead
returning undefined. I then used to filter() to remove the zeroes but this also presented a problem as the index was important because of place value.

<img src="https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/16.3.2023.2CW.png" alt="code snippet" />

I then realised I was over thinking this problem and realised I could use a simple forEach to skip over the zeroes and push the manipulated number to another array

## Day 17 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 17th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about clean coding from my mentor - code should read like a story and be understandable for others. I also learnt about 'failing first' which is a way of adding test conditions in your function that eliminate pointless running of code.
- Participated in a hackathon where we pair programmed a game of rock, paper scissors.
- We presented our project and code to other teams and talked them through our thinking and steps.

### Thoughts:

Today's mentor meeting was incredibly informative. I learnt a lot about how to go about breaking problems down and making plans, and what that means in a practical sense. It means that other people can read your code and understand what it is that you are doing and what it is that you are trying to do. This is especially important within teams where people can move from project to project multiple times - even in one day.

The hackathon involved creating a game of rock paper scissors. We managed to complete most of it. The key lesson I learnt was on collaborating with others and working together through making a plan, pair programming and sharing via GitHub.

## Day 18 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 18th March_

### Today's progress:

- Applied what I learnt about problem solving over the past week to solve a level 5 Codewars kata.
- Did some reading around ChatGPT and the best way to use this tool.
- Forked project hackathon repo and refactored the code

### Thoughts:

As I had more time today I decided to attempt a level 5 kata and approach it in the way that SoC have taught over the past week. I made a thorough plan and broke each section down. When unsure I put in what I thought a possible approach may be. I found that breaking everything down in such detail made the parts I understood far more straightforward to code. With the parts that I didn't understand, it was easy to see what I needed to search for.

<img src='https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/18-3-2023-plan.svg' />

I also worked on refactoring the code from the hackathon yesterday. A really useful task as I looked for patterns and was able to tidy up the code. I made sure each action was done by one function and created a function that controlled the game.

## Day 19 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 19th March_

### Today's progress:

- Completed codewars challenge on strings and arrays
- Spent some time reviewing array and string methods
- Did some reading and watched a video om chatGPT and the best way to use it as a tool

### Thoughts:

Today's codewars challenge was straight forward. I still made a plan and noticed that I picked up on potential mistakes I would have made while coding.

<img src="https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/mexican-wave1.svg" />

I then spent some time looking at the code to see if I could improve it. I realised that I did not need the if statement. I removed it and the code was still functioning as it should.

<img src="https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/wave2.svg" />

I learnt that chatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool but can also be dangerous for learners and early career level developers. It can be useful to generate questions to practice your skills and check syntax etc. Doing more complicated actions with it can be risky if you do not have the understanding and experience of your programming language at a deeper level.

## Day 20 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 20th March_

### Today's progress:

- Today I learnt that the DOM (Document Object Model) takes our static HTML and makes it into an object that we can manipulate.
- I learnt how to select elements, how to manipulate the text content of selected elements, how to append elements to the DOM, how to loop through a NodeList and how to remove elements.
- I did some background reading to further understand the DOM and how to manipulate it.

### Thoughts:

We covered a lot today regarding the DOM and how to manipulate it. I found it incredibly useful to be able to work through the assigned tasks in a group as we could discuss and plan together and then tackle the tasks. I found it useful to research how to use certain methods, for example removeChild.

Today's codewars challenge was regarding manipulating strings. Part of the challenge was to leave certain words lowercase. These words were passed in as a string as the second argument. However this argument was optional. Initially, when this second argument was not passed, I was getting errrors. I realised that I could overcome these errors by setting the default value of that parameter as an empty string instead of using if statements to check.

```
function titleCase(title, minorWords = '')

```

## Day 21 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 21th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learned about events in JavaScript and the event object and some of its properties and values
- I learned about event listeners and the different types of events they can be called on
- I learned about how to incorporate AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot into my learning - to use them but ensure that we understand exactly what the code is doing

### Thoughts:

Before bootcamp started today, I completed a codewars challenge adding a new method to the String prototype. I also watched a video on writing clean, concise code by Christopher Miller.

In our teams we worked on adding event listeners to a site to carry out actions on various events such as click, mouse enter or keyup. I also explored the event object in the console and was able to use some of what I discovered to perform different actions.

I also learned about AI tools and how powerful they can be but also how we should carefully approach the code that is written for us. We asked ChatGPT to generate the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code for a basic rock, paper, scissors game. I found that there were errors in the code that needed debugging, however the very basic game did eventually work. I refactored the code to remove the onclick event listener from the HTML and instead added event listeners to the JavaScript file. I found the more precise I was in my language with Github Copilot the more useful the code was for my intended purpose.

## Day 22 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 22th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript and the async methods setTimeout() and setInterval as well as the event loop.
- I learnt about API's and how to use the fetch method to send a GET request.
- I applied everything I learnt to send a GET request to cat fact API. I used event listeners to make the page dynamic.

### Thoughts:

Codewars had me stumped for a while this morning but I realised after putting some console logs that my map method was resetting my count to 1 each time it was running despite me thinking it was being updated.

JavaScript is single-threaded but asynchronous functions allow it to behave like it is multi-threaded and non-blocking. The event loop organises the order in which code is executed.

API's can be accessed using the fetch method. Fetch is asynchronous and returns a promise. We need to wait for the promise to resolve or reject before we can do anything with it. Using the async keyword before the function and then await within the function allows us to wait for the promise to resolve without blocking the rest of the code.

## Day 23 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 23th March_

### Today's progress:

- Did some research on Chrome's dev tools and came together and presented what we discovered to everyone.
- Learnt about UI/UX principles - the most important takeaway being "Don't make users think"
- Used destructuring assignment and object methods to solve a coding challenge.

### Thoughts:

After solving a codewars challenge on my own this morning, I was also able to spend some time solving some problems together in our team. It's a useful way of troubleshooting and I find thinking out loud with others is helping me to cement ideas and language into my understanding.

Also spent some time planning out an app that will allow users to practice times tables. I managed to code a basic structure and will add to it over the coming few days.

## Day 24 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 24th March_

### Today's progress:

- Researched APIs as a team, chose one and made a plan for what to build.
- Used the fetch method as well as async and await to get data from the API and extracted what we needed.
- Built a simple web app that takes user input and responds with data from the API.

### Thoughts:

Today was hackathon day. We were tasked to explore a few APIs, select one and create an app. We spent a decent amount of time ensuring that we had the foundations of an app that we could then build further features on, time permitting. We decided to go with a dad joke API and to set the page up as a text based conversation. Ultimately, we found that the JavaScript was mostly straightforward, it was the CSS that caused us problems.

We struggled at first to align the elements as if it was a conversation. We were mostly able to overcome this by lots of research and working together. It made me realise that I could definitely do with some more CSS practice.

## Day 25 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 25th March_

### Today's progress:

- Completed codewars challenge on the topic of arrays and adding methods to the prototype
- Revised all the content covered so far by SoC
- Read around the topic of UI/UX in preparation for next week

### Thoughts:

Today was a busy day so I didn't manage to get as much coding done as I would have liked.

I completed a codewars challenge that involved adding methods to the Array prototype. Allowed me to get some more understanding of the this keyword.

I spent some time revising all the topics covered so far by SoC - objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, APIs, async/sync functions and event listeners.

## Day 26 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 26th March_

### Today's progress:

- Completed codewars challenge on the topic of objects, getters and setters
- Spent some time creating a simple cat image app using an API with event listeners
- Created a simple to-do list app that takes in a task and a number and displays tasks by priorities

### Thoughts:

Today's codewars challenge was involved creating a function that returned an object with getter and setter methods. I couldn't get it to work at first but I realised quickly that the error was in the setter method where I wasn't assigning the argument to the variable.

I enjoyed completing the homework tasks today. The to-do list was the most challenging. Organising the tasks by priority was tricky at first. I needed to remove the list as it was on the page. I found this was done by setting the innerHTML property to an empty string. The next task was to sort the items by priority. I used the sort method to sort the array by lowest to highest priority. I then looped over the array of items and reused a function to add the list items by priority.

Given more time, I plan on adding styles as well as some more functionality. I would like to add the ability to remove items and sort the priorities as a new item is added.

## Day 27 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 27th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt more about the benefits of developing software with an agile methodology
- I learnt a little about what a site reliability engineer (SRE) does from Dave Adams.
- I spent some time on CSSGrid and Flexbox, and added further functionality to rock/paper/scissors game.

### Thoughts:

I learnt more about the agile methodology, it's core values and a little of the history and how it first came about. I did some further research on the Atlassian website. I think fundamentally it is a process that involves understanding, collaborating, learning and staying flexible and gives you the ability to deliver value to customers far quicker.

I spent some time working on a previous project - rps game. I added further functionality to it by allowing the user to pick 3/5/7 games, the winner being the one who wins the most. I applied what I learnt today on CSSGrid and Flexbox to the styling of the game.

## Day 28 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 28th March_

### Today's progress:

- Spent a lot of time today looking at UX - user experience. More specifically the five stages of design.
- Spent more time working on RPS game - added score tracker and worked on CSS
- Challenging Codewars kata today, involving taking in a string of names and returning a string sorted alphabetically and in a specific format.

### Thoughts:

Not much coding today with SoC as we covered UX and the design process. I found it interesting how it is also a very iterative process similar to the agile methodology. I learnt a lot about how design should be user centered but of course keeping business needs in mind.

My Codewars challenge today was really fun as it really stretched my understanding of the sort method for arrays. I also used destructured assignment to split out the names in the string. I had to play around with the sort method and what it returned in order to get the correct sorting of names. I then refactored the code and split some of the things into separate functions.

## Day 29 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 29th March_

### Today's progress:

- Focus on UI - accessibility, lighthouse audits ac colour theory were just some of the topics we covered
- I learnt how to make a wireframe using Figma and why wireframes are necessary
- I learnt more about CSS, specifically the way our CSS should be organised

### Thoughts:

I found the discussions around accessibility very interesting today. The lighthouse audit is a very useful tool to not only see how your website performs but als how accessible it is.

I need to spend more time on Figma and practice how to build a wireframe. I feel it will be a really useful tool to help me build my own projects.

I had a lot of fun attempting to build a BBC clone today in HTML and CSS. I didn't have as much time as I would have like so will be coming back to it on the weekend hopefully. It was a really useful exercise as it helped me to put in to practice what I learnt about Flexbox and CSSGrid.

## Day 30 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 30th March_

### Today's progress:

- Great mindset talk today on the dangers of positional thinking and the values of deep listening - all vital skills to be able to work successfully in a team.
- Lots of research on accessibility and what that means for design
- Spent time after SoC working on clone project from yesterday as well as codewars

### Thoughts:

Accessibility is such a large topic with so many tools and tips out there to ensure we incorporate it into our design that we should never leave it as an afterthought. Presenting what we found in our research is a really useful task as it allows you to distil what you have learnt into a short succinct summary so that your team can quickly understand what you discovered.

I spent some time once School of Code was over continuing to work on my BBC clone site. It's been really useful in building up my CSS skills. Still a long way to go but definitely feel I understand CSSGrid a lot better.

Also spent some time doing some codewars challenge - some as pair programming and some in my own time. The level 6 kata was quite tricky but I feel I am getting a better understanding of objects and array methods and how I can combine them to solve a problem.

## Day 31 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 31st March_

### Today's progress:

- Combined everything we learnt over the past week on UI/UX principles
- Built up figma and wireframing skills by creating a landing page
- Built a landing page for our fictional School of Cooking bootcamp, keeping accessibility and the user in mind at all times.

### Thoughts:

Today's challenge for the hackathon was to apply all we had learnt over the week to build a landing page for our bootcamp. This involved going over our user personas and stories, working through our user journey flow diagram and then creating a wireframe that would keep our user at the forefront of our design. We then went on to create a plan for our HTML and CSS. The rest of our day was spent working on our landing page through pair-programming. We were able to work really well together and got a lot done. We didn't manage to complete the HTML and CSS for our design but I am hoping to do that over the weekend.

## Day 32 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 1st April_

### Today's progress:

- Tricky codewars challenge that needed to throw an error depending on the argument passed to the function
- I worked on the landing page I started yesterday and got it to an acceptable level of completion, though it could be improved.
- Made sure my CSS was well organised and my HTML elements were chosen based on semantic meaning

### Thoughts:

The logic of today's codewars kata was quite challenging. I needed to throw an error if the argument was false but return an empty array if the argument was '0' or 0. I had to arrange the conditions in a way that satisfied all the requirements - I mostly did this with trial and error.

I spent a few hours today completing yesterday's hackathon. I finished off the section we were working on and added two more and a footer. I really enjoyed it as I got some more Flexbox and CSS practice.

I went over my code and made sure that the HTML tags were all chosen for their semantic meaning, I also went over my CSS and made sure it was well organised and that I reused classes when it made sense.

## Day 33 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 2nd April_

### Today's progress:

- Did some reading around the topic of writing clean code
- Started work on the recap tasks for SoC - designing a portfolio site for myself
- Watched some videos on testing and Node.js

### Thoughts:

I had a busy life day today so didn't get as much coding done as I would ordinarily. It was interesting to learn how to test JavaScript code and how to write those tests. Looking forward to learning more about this topic and getting more familiar with Node.

## Day 34 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 4 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 3rd April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about test driven development: the importance of it, the different types and ways to go about testing.
- I learnt about Node.js and how it allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.
- I initialised a node project and exported and imported modules and installed third party packages.

### Thoughts:

I really enjoyed learning about Node.js today. I learnt many new commands for the command line, including how to add and run an npm script. I learnt about EMS which I did further research on and found it is the syntax and rules by which we can import and export modules by. It also allows us to import from anywhere in the code as long as we do so asynchronously and not just from the top of the file

I spent some time after SoC practising some more using learn your node. I also did a codewars challenge.

## Day 35 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 4 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 4th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt the difference between unit tests, integration tests and system wide tests
- I learnt about the 3 A's pattern which helps you structure tests in a way that makes them easier to read and understand
- We wrote some functions and the tests to go with them within our team

### Thoughts:

I learnt unit tests test individual units of code i.e. one function. Integration tests combine some of those units and then tests if they still work. End to end tests the performance of the whole application.

We used Jest to write some unit tests for some functions. We imported in the necessary functions from jest and then used them to test our functions.

My codewars challenge was quite tricky and while I was able to understand some of the logic and pass some tests I couldn't complete it. I spent some time looking at the solutions and added some of the code that I saw to my anki flashcards. The solutions made sense when I read through the code I just didn't understand the logic.

## Day 36 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 4 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 5th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about end to end testing - testing the whole app or project.
- I spent time reading and understanding the documentation for Playwright - the tool we are using to carry out our e2e tests.
- I wrote e2e tests for a simple to-do list app

### Thoughts:

Today was a super interesting day. I really enjoyed learning how to write tests to simulate a user interacting with an app. It did take trial and error and spending a lot of time with the documentation. We were able to write a test that checked that the page loaded, that the input could be typed into, that when the button was clicked the item appeared underneath and the same for when enter was pressed. We were also able to check that the text that was input matched the text in the list of to-do's.

In the evening, I spent some more time watching some videos on writing tests to get a deeper understanding.

## Day 37 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 4 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 6th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt how to use the debugging tool when running tests.
- I wrote tests as part of a team using Playwright.
- I did a presentation on my learning today.

### Thoughts:

Today's mindset session at SoC was an interesting one about our inner critic and inner champion. It helped to understand where the negative thoughts come from and why.

We has a shorter hackathon today due to the bank holiday tomorrow. It was really useful to apply what I learned yesterday about end to end testing on today's hackathon. I found that the code we were writing today was already better than what we did yesterday. Watching the videos yesterday evening definitely helped.

The debugging tool also came in handy to go through the code step by step. I was also able to share how to use this with team members.

## Day 38 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 4 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 7th April_

### Today's progress:

- Bank holiday today so no Soc - Codewars challenge on ASCII art - creating a diamond of a given length.
- Created my own Codewars challenge. Tested expected outcomes using Jest.
- I started learning React - what it is used for and some basics

### Thoughts:

I got close to solving today's challenge but found myself stuck towards the end. I wa able to create the first half of the diamond but not the rest. I asked ChatGPT for help and was able to correctly recreate a diamond. I made sure to then delete the code and write it out again so I could understand an learn from it.

I also created my own Codewars challenge. I did this by first creating an idea of what I want to do, I then wrote out a plan of the tests that I would need. I then created the tests but I found this a bit tricky without having the function code. I think test driven development will take some practice, but it a was a very interesting exercise.

_Sunday 9th April_

### Today's progress:

- Did some reading on React and watched a video
- Codewars
- Made a plan on resources I want to use tomorrow to learn React

### Thoughts:

I didn't manage to complete my codewars challenge today. I feel I am close so I am hoping to solve it tomorrow. I also made a plan on how I want to approach learning React tomorrow. This weekend has been very busy but I will hopefully be able to dedicate more time tomorrow

## Day 41 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 5 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 10th April_

### Today's progress:

- Solved yesterday's codewars challenge that I was stuck on
- Watched a React crash course video
- Read the React docs to get more practice reading documentation

### Thoughts:

I approached my codewars challenge fresh this morning after being stuck on it yesterday. I found that working out on paper how I would solve a solution was the best first approach. I found it a bit tricky to then convert this to code. I found I was getting a partial correct answer but needed to use console logs to understand where I was going wrong. I found that the way I was assigning variables at the beginning of the loop was incorrect and I realised using destructuring would work better as they would be assigned simultaneously.

I'm getting more familiar with React and how to use it. I'm looking forward to learn more this coming week and start building projects using it.

## Day 42 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 5 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 11th April_

### Today's progress:

- React is a JS library that allows us to create highly performant user interfaces by creating UI components.
- The virtual DOM is a representation of UI kept in memory. It compares its current state with the actual DOM and makes changes and updates accordingly.
- We create components using functions - each component should do one thing(the single responsibility principle)

### Thoughts:

We covered a lot of the fundamentals of React. We began by using raw React in a html file and then moved on to using create-react-app which allows us to set up a React app in one simple command. We looked at component trees as a plan for an app.We also covered importing, exporting, using JSX and destructuring with props. Props is an object that is created and passed to an element. We can then access the values of the prop object using dot notation.

I spent some time doing a codewars challenge and completing the workshop from the day. Also I made sure to add a lot of the learning from today to my flashcards app.

## Day 43 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 5 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 12th April_

### Today's progress:

- Learnt about the hooks API in react which was release in 2018
- Went deeper with useState
- Learnt more about how to manage where the state of a component should be stored using a component tree

### Thoughts:

The useState hook allows us to keeps track of the state of a variable and then allows us to set this state using a function. We can set the initial state by passing in an argument to useState. This can be any data type including numbers, strings, arrays, objects and booleans.

I learnt how important it is to track the data flow and keep in mind where the best place is to set the state of a variable you need to keep track of.

I learned how to pass functions as props down to components which can then be used e.g. with onClick and onChange.

## Day 44 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 5 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 13th April_

### Today's progress:

- Mindset session covering different ways to come to a decision as a team.
- I learnt about a immutability and why that's important especially when using states in React
- Used the spread operator and the map, filter and slice array method to understand how to make changes immutably

### Thoughts:

The mindset session today was very interesting as we covered how group decisions are not about the right answer but about what the group wants to do, because often there is no right answer.

I learnt about how immutability is incredibly important when talking about state changes in React. If we don't make changes immutably then we change the original object and React can't compare the old version to the new version and re-render accordingly.

I learnt about how to use the spread operator and the slice array method to make changes, insert items, remove items etc. all done immutably. I also learnt about shallow copies and deep copies and how that can be done using the slice method.

## Day 45 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 5 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 14th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt how to get a value from an input onClick and add it to an array.
- I stored the array file as a separate module and used it to update the todo list.
- I was able to update and make changes to the page and array file using add and delete buttons.

### Thoughts:

HACKATHON

Today's hackathon challenge was to create a todo list app that would allow us to add a to do to a list, display the list of todos and then delete something off the todo list if the delete button was pressed.

We began by creating a plan and a component tree diagram that would show us where we needed to set states and which component would be passed props. I struggle a bit with the planning of an app such as this and the creating of a component tree diagram as I find I'm not certain about what I need to use and pass down until we start coding. I am getting better at this and think it's just a a case of creating more React apps to understand the flow a little better.

We found at first that the way that made sense to us was to create a separate file that would contain our todo's in an array. This was because we were unsure how to pass the todo item over to the list component when they were on the same level (not parent/child). We quickly realised that we needed useState to create and array and keep track of it. We were able to code the add button but didn't have time to complete the app.

My plan for the weekend is to start from scratch and create the app again.

## Day 46 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 16th April_

### Today's progress:

- I re-did the to-do list app from scratch.
- I spent some more time reading React docs.
- I found I understood much more than I did yesterday.

### Thoughts:

Today I spent time recreating the to-do list app from scratch. I found this task incredibly beneficial in terms of cementing some of concepts I learned yesterday. Making mistakes and learning from them is really helping me to understand and avoid those mistakes again. All in all I found it far more straightforward to code the app today than I did yesterday.

I also began planning out a blog post app. I created a detailed component tree that includes states, props and behaviour.

### Links to work / resources:

https://github.com/anjiqbal/todo-list-app

## Day 47 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 16th April_

### Today's progress:

- I created a blog post app that allows users to leave a comment.
- I read more about how to structure a React app and some of the approaches to take when coding it.
- I spent some time with fellow bootcampers trouble shooting code, and talking through what we had learnt.

### Thoughts:

I found today's task would have been really difficult without my plan from yesterday. The guidance for the task had a bottom up approach when coding out the components, I found this confusing and found a bottom down approach made more sense to me.
This is where my plan really helped. I found myself referring back to it quite often in order to understand exactly what states/ props were required where.

The form for the user input was the trickiest part for me. I had put the onSubmit function on the button but found that that did not work. After some googling I realised that the onSubmit function needed to go on the form tag. I also learnt about preventDefault() which stops the page refreshing when onSubmit is called.

## Day 48 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 6 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 17th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about pure and impure functions
- I learnt about side effects and how to deal with them using useEffect
- I learnt how to implement useEffect to fetch data from an api.

### Thoughts:

Pure functions are predictable and always return the same output for a given input. It has no side effects and does not rely on any external data. An impure function modifies data outside of it's scope or has side effects such as HTTP requests and directly changing the DOM.

I also learnt about useEffect and how it allows us to perform side effects in our components. It takes a function as it's first argument and an array of dependencies as it's second argument. The dependencies tells React when the effect should be executed. If it is an empty array, it will execute once (on mount), otherwise it will execute whenever one of the dependencies change. If it is left out React will execute the effect every time there is a re-render of the component.

## Day 49 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 6 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 18th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about switch cases and how they are used in React in useReducer.
- I learnt that useReducer separates logic which changes state from the components which use it. It also ensures that state can only be changed in an explicit number of ways.
- I refactored a component that used useState to make it carry out the same functionality with useReducer.

### Thoughts:

Today's main focus was the useReducer hook. We began by looking at switch cases which I was quite familiar with. We also looked at finite state machines - I found this slightly confusing but as far as I understand it's just a system where particular inputs cause particular changes and anything that is not one of those inputs will not make a change.

I refactored code that had implemented useState to now use useReducer. I found breaking the steps down helped. 1.Create the reducer function that deals with the logic separate to the component function 2. implement the component hook inside the component app 3. Use the dispatch function inside a button for example.

I'm finding it slightly tricky to keep the thread of the different moving parts but I know with more practice and typing out the code a few more times, I'll have a more confident grasp of it.

## Day 50 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 6 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 19th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about git branching - creating new branches, making changes, resolving conflicts and merging
- I learnt about the React testing library - a lightweight testing library that can be used with a test runner such as Jest
- I learnt about render and screen as well as some other matchers and queries

### Thoughts:

We spent the morning getting familiar with git branching. I learnt the git commands necessary to create new branches and how to navigate around them. I learned how to review pull requests, resolve conflicts, merge changes and delete branches. It is a very powerful tool that will help us immensely going into our projects next week.

We also learnt more testing today - specifically how to test components built in React. It is always important to remember to write tests as if it was a user interacting with the app. We wrote tests using various matchers and queries. I found `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` to be a very useful way of seeing what was happening.

## Day 51 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 6 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 20th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about tools that will make working on our projects next week much smoother
- I learnt more about agile methodology and how to apply it
- I spent time working on an app that uses the Pokemon TCG API to build a place where a user can organise, filter and search for cards.

### Thoughts:

We covered a lot of prep today to ensure that our projects next week and our work as a team are as successful as possible. This included learning about the mindset of working in teams that can progress, make decisions and work well together. We also learnt about project planning tools and more about the agile methodology.

Today I made a start on something I have been wanting to build for a while - a place where a user can view, organise and sort Pokemon cards. Today was mainly set up. Although I do not need an API key, I learnt about the .env file and environment variables, how to store them and add them to a .gitignore file so that they are not public. I also linked to the API using the useEffect hook.

## Day 52 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 6 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 21st April_

### Today's progress:

- Went through all of the planning stages needed to build an MVP - ideation, user story, MVP and stretch goals and component tree.
- I understood to a deeper level the importance of user stories - if you build for everyone you are building for no one.
- I used Postman to select an API and check whether it was active.

### Thoughts:

HACKATHON

Today's hackathon task was to select an API and build an MVP. We chose a recipe API after first checking to see if it returned data using Postman. We then spent a considerable amount of time planning. I found this incredibly beneficial as it made me really put the user at the forefront of my mind when creating the app. We decided to build an app that would take in an ingredient and return recipes that use that ingredient. We didn't manage to complete our app but we were very close. I built on a lot of skills that I know will be useful going into project week

## Day 53 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 22nd April_

### Today's progress:

- More work on API's and extracting data
- Read about how to convert objects to arrays
- Added search functionality to my Pokemon app

### Thoughts:

I spent some time working on my Pokemon project today. I added an input that allows a user to search for a particular Pokemon. I struggled with this the week before but found that it was far easier and more straightforward today.

## Day 54 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 23rd April_

### Today's progress:

- I added functionality to hackathon project that displays the meals after a user presses enter
- I added functionality to hackathon project that allows a user to click on meal and see ingredients and recipe and if he clicks on it again it disappears
- I spent a lot of time understanding states and how to use them in the above scenarios

### Thoughts:

I spent a large part of my time today completing our hackathon project. I worked on it step by step adding more functionality as I went. I found it confusing at times but was able to eventually make the app work as I wanted. I will go over the code again to cement my understanding of how it works.

## Day 55 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 7 - School of Code Bootcamp

## Project Week

_Monday 24th April_

### Today's progress:

- Given the task to solve an issue for someone on a coding bootcamp - we conducted user research and ideated and narrowed down an issue to solve
- We worked on our plans, wireframe and breaking tasks down using Trello
- Conducted research into Front-end libraries such as Material UI and data visualisation libraries

### Thoughts:

Day one of project week got off to a good start. We carried out user research and settled on creating an app for bootcampers that would help them keep track of their fitness. We used Disney ideation to go from dreamer to realist to critic with our ideas. We created user stories and then narrowed down the features we want in our MVP. I think we have hit a balance of not being too cautious without being too over ambitious. We have started work on wireframes and also started putting tasks up on Trello so tha we can keep track of what needs doing.

## Project Week

_Tuesday 25th April_

### Today's progress:

- Completed wireframes and component tree
- Created backlog of work to be done on Trello and assigned tasks
- completed initial setup of app and began coding in pairs

### Thoughts:

I Feel really pleased with the progress we have made today and the stage we are at with our app. We have created all the components we need and added the basic code that each one will require. We then worked on adding functionality to our code. I worked with David today on our 'login page'. It is difficult in one sense as we have no backend so are unable to complete some things as we would if we did have a backend. We will need to hardcode our data but that is ok as long as we can make updates between renders and demonstrate those changes. There is plenty I am learning about the decision making progress amd really thinking about why we make the decisions we do. I am trying to keep a log of some of these as they are easily forgotten during the process of completing a project but I feel they are the interesting aspect of the project as they will be different for everyone.

## Day 57 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 7 - School of Code Bootcamp

## Project Week

_Wednesday 26th April_

### Today's progress:

- I learned a little about the React router library
- I wrote some user tests using React testing library
- We came together as a team to discuss progress made and any adjustments we should make in our plan

### Thoughts:

Another productive day, getting the bulk of our MVP coded. We worked in pairs on different areas of functionality including linking up step counts with days, setting weekly goals and writing tests. We had decided on a number of milestones at which we would get together and discuss our progress. One of these was Wednesday afternoon. We talked about what we had managed to do and what we would need to put aside in order to have a complete MVP by the next day before lunch. This was a hugely beneficial discussion as it meant we would have time to complete our basic functionality to a high standard and have time to prepare for our presentations.

## Day 58 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 7 - School of Code Bootcamp

## Project Week

_Thursday 27th April_

### Today's progress:

- I worked on my code reading skill by reading code written by team members in order to add further functionality
- I worked on numerous bug fixes
- We carried out a thorough retrospective in order to plan our presentation

### Thoughts:

Today's code was mainly bug fixing and making sure the app would work for the user as intended. For example, making sure a user could only enter a number for the step count and weekly goal. We also worked on the CSS for the app. We had initially discussed using a frontend library but decided that the learning curve would be too great and as time was limited it was better to work with what we know. We spent the afternoon doing a retrospective and preparing for our presentation.

## Day 59 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 7 - School of Code Bootcamp

## Project Week

_Friday 28th April_

### Today's progress:

- I spent time refactoring code and making sure the user experience was as good as it could be given our time constraints
- I presented our MVP as part of a team to industry judges
- We conducted a retrospective on the project as a whole - what we did well, and what we could have done better

### Thoughts:

We spent some time this morning making sure our code worked as it should. We refactored some code and made some minor css changes. We then reviewed and rehearsed our presentation. We presented our MVP and our process to three industry judges. We first went through our ideation and design process, we then talked about how we worked together and then presented the app. We also spoke about our key learning points from the week. We were then asked questions. The first was on whether we each coded every area of the app as well as taking part in the design process. We answered that we had designed together and we each participated in every area of the app. We were asked about how we ensured accessibility, we mentioned labels for inputs as well as the lighthouse test and that we are aware that this isn't a complete test. We were also asked about responsiveness.

## Day 60 & 61 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 29th April_ _&_ _Sunday 30th April_

### Today's progress:

- Based on a comment a judge made on Friday about using an accessibility first approach, I did some reading and found some resources
- I spent some time reflecting on project week and made notes on what I would do better next time
- I solved some codewars katas

### Thoughts:

When presenting our project on Friday to the industry judges, one of the judges - Paul Hawxby - talked about how to ensure your app is inclusive and available for all by designing and developing with an accessibility first approach. I spent some time researching this approach and found some resources that will be really helpful. He also told us about testing your website on https://www.siteimprove.com/website-checker/ and also going through your site using a screen reader to really understand a user's experience. These are some things I will take forward into future projects.

I will also make sure that for our future project, the team manifesto includes a focus on accessibility first. I will also include in the manifesto the importance of documenting decisions as we go, and assigning someone every day who will make a note of those decisions.

_Monday 1st May_

### Today's progress:

- Went over code from project week and made a start refactoring it
- Completed a Codewars challenge and did some revision using Anki flashcards
- Made a start with Kevin Powell's responsive layout course

### Thoughts:

Began today with a codewars challenge as it has been over a week since I had done one and find that they are a very useful way of learning new things and keeping syntax and problem solving skills at the forefront of my mind.

I also spent time looking through our project code and made a start refactoring it and making sure I understand all aspects of it. I also began a course on responsive layouts as this is an area I feel I could improve in.

_Tuesday 2nd May_

### Today's progress:

- Carried out a thorough retrospective on our project sprint last week
- Put together a study plan for areas that I feel I need to work on
- Continued with responsive layout course and did some codewars

### Thoughts:

Today we discussed different aspects of our project and the areas where we felt we did well and areas where we could have done better. It was useful to discuss this with the team after having reflected on this myself over the weekend. I also put together a plan for topics I want to cover this week as we have some time to do some self study. I plan on continuing with the CSS course I began as well as getting some React practice by adding more to my project.

## Week 8 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 3rd May_

### Today's progress:

- Employability session - worked on our LinkedIn profiles and learnt more about the support SoC provides
- Solved a number of CodeWars katas in our team
- Worked after hours with another bootcamper on PokeDeck app

### Thoughts:

We spent the morning learning more about the support SoC provides and working on our LinkedIn profiles. We had more time today following our own learning plans. I ended up doing a few codewars challenges with this week's team and found it really useful. Also made a very small start on a wireframe for my PokeDeck app. I was also joined after hours by Sam who wanted to join me in working on my PokeDeck app, it's really great to have another person on board. I'm excited to see where we go with it.

## Week 8 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 4th May_

### Today's progress:

- Employability session - worked on my CV and made it relevant to the tech industry
- Solved a number of CodeWars katas in our team
- Worked on CSS layouts and wireframe for PokeDeck project

### Thoughts:

We solved some tricky codewars challenges today and used the array methods some and every. Something interesting I came across was initialising a variable that should store the highest number from an array to -Infinity. I had not come across this before but found it an interesting way of solving the problem. I knew I couldn't initialise it to 0 as the array included negative numbers so this was a clever way around that problem.

Also spent some time working on CSS and wireframes. The basic wireframes are complete and we are ready to start adding more code to the project during tomorrows session after SoC.

## Week 8 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 5th May_

### Today's progress:

- Consolidated skills we've been working on so far by building the front-end side of an e-commerce site
- Used Material UI to render a rating component
- Worked on PokeDeck app after hours with Sam

### Thoughts:

Hackathon

We were tasked with creating the front-end of an e-commerce site that was populated with data from an API. We struggled to begin with as we had a GitHub issue and found that we had lost an hour and a half's work. Once we sorted this issue out we began working on our project. We approached the project with basic CSS first which is an approach I haven't used before. We also used Material UI which was new to me. We used this to render the rating component which displayed the star rating for each product.

Also spent some time working on PokeDeck project. We used React Router to set up the routes so that when the search button is pressed it takes you to another page that will then display the cards. We struggled to pass the state to the page so although we were able to navigate to a different page, the cards were not displaying. I will do some research and hopefully figure out where we are going wrong.

## Day 67 & 68 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 6th May_ _&_ _Sunday 7th May_

### Today's progress:

- Worked on Friday's hackathon project by adding search functionality
- Worked on the CSS for the hackathon project by redoing it all again and making it responsive
- Spent some time going over React concepts that don't feel so strong for me and going over CSS grid and flexbox

### Thoughts:

Most of my work this weekend was on the hackathon project. I made my own copy of the repo and spent some time working on it to make it look how I would like as well as making it responsive.

I spent a lot of time on CSS this weekend. I still don't feel confident with grid and flexbox and definitely benefited from the practice. I also added the ability to search for specific items within the store data. This was trickier than I initially expected and so I had to change my initial approach. I ended up adding more state to the App component and adding another useEffect that would trigger on change to the search term state. I spent some time going over this code again to make sure I understand each aspect.

- Spent time going over code that I don't fell 100% confident with and asking ChatGPT to explain it
- Watched an intro to Node.js tutorial video

### Thoughts:

I spent more time on revision today. I felt it was important that I feel confident with the front-end now that we are moving to the back-end this week.

I made good use of ChatGPT today by asking for explanations for some code line by line. When I felt that I still had questions, I asked for further explanations and examples. I find this conversational, questioning style of learning works really well with ChatGPT and it helps solve some of those often very simple questions that you sometimes have but that would be difficult to Google.

I also watched a tutorial on Node so that when we begin back-end tomorrow it won't be totally unfamiliar. I'm looking forward to getting stuck in over the next few weeks.

## Day 70 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 9 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 9th May_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt what Node.js is - open source software that runs on different operating systems and allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer or server
- I learnt about non-blocking code and event driven programming
- I used the native file system module to read and write files.

### Thoughts:

Today was all about Node.js. I learnt about non-blocking code that allows your computer to move on and complete other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete. This increases performance and efficiency. I learnt about event-driven programming that allows a computer to react to events that happen in the system. Instead of following a predetermined set of instructions, it listens for events and reacts to them as they occur. This allows for flexible and dynamic programs commonly used in UI's and web development.

In the afternoon we used the Node core module that allows you to access file systems. After some practice, we wrote functions that allow a user to create a quote, get all quotes and get a random quote.

## Day 71 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 9 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 10th May_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt web fundamentals - IP addresses, ports, sockets, domain names, DNS, HTTP - methods and requests
- I built a simple server and tested it using Thunder Client - a similar tool to Postman
- Used express and Node.js to build a REST API with endpoints that allow a user to create, read, update and delete

### Thoughts:

Big day today covering web fundamentals and continuing to build our REST API. The web fundamentals session was really helpful, covering a lot of the necessary theory tha gives the background context of working in the back end.

We also started working with Express today. We began by building a simple server and then testing it using Thunder Client. Although I had used Postman before, it was only at a very basic level so it was really interesting to see just how much these tools are capable of.

The afternoon was spent continuing to work on our API. This time we created API endpoints to CRUD resources. We found this quite tricky but were able to work it out and troubleshoot our errors.

I also attended an after hours session run by Hamza that went over everything that we covered today and allowed us to ask as many questions as we needed. I found it very helpful and it helped me to get a better understanding of some of the concepts we covered earlier.

## Day 72 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 9 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 11th May_

### Today's progress:

- Tackled middleware today - built-in, custom and third party
- How to write our own custom middleware
- How to use express.static() to serve static files

### Thoughts:

Today we added another layer to the backend - middleware. We spent a lot of time playing around with our server code, breaking it, generating and exploring errors and exploring what is happening with console logs.

We also had a talk today from Eli and Nadeem from Talis. They covered what a REST API is, the important aspects of it and how to follow the conventions of writing a REST API.

I also attended a codebar event that was very informative. I was paired with a coach who helped me understand Express a little better. We also talked about employability and I took away some good tips for my CV and how to approach the job hunt.

## Day 73 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 9 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 12th May_

### Today's progress:

HACKATHON

- Took our time understanding the requirements of the hackathon and the files that were given to us
- Created Crud functionality
- Hooked up helper functions to API endpoints

### Thoughts:

We decided as a team that we would take our time today and make sure that the team as a whole understood every part of what we were doing before we moved on. We knew this was important as this was quite a heavy learning week and we wanted to make sure we had solid understanding before next week.

We struggled with our PATCH method and found that we couldn't event get a console log up and the error 404. After struggling for a while we realised we had a missing forward slash in the URI,so that was an important lesson to learn.

My plan is to come back to this over the weekend, finish up the back-end and then hook it up to the front-end.

## Day 74 & 75 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 13th May_ _&_ _Sunday 14th May_

### Today's progress:

- Went over hackathon code to make sure I understood it
- Hooked up the front-end to the back-end functionality
- Created another REST API and CRUD functionality

### Thoughts:

I spent lots of time this weekend reinforcing all the learning from this past week. I hooked up the front-end to the back-end - only the POST, DELETE and GET HTTP methods. This wasn't as tricky as I thought it would be. I am yet to add the update functionality to the front-end, I feel as though this may take me a little longer.

I then created a new REST API and the CRUD functionality and endpoints that went with it. This further reinforced my learning and I feel far more confident with Express and Node.

## Day 76 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 10 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 15th May_

### Today's progress:

- I learned about relational and non-relational databases
- I wrote SQL queries to query a database
- I worked on PokeDeck before and after School of Code

### Thoughts:

I learnt that non-relational or NoSQL databases are useful for large amounts of data and that relational or SQL databases are used when your data is structured and consistency is priority. SQL is used to interact with relational databases and allows you to perform CRUD actions on your resources. I practised writing queries using https://sqlbolt.com.

I also worked on the PokeDeck app in the morning by myself and then later in the afternoon with Sam. I mainly added CSS in the morning but in the afternoon Sam and I implemented a new feature that displays a random Pokemon card on the home page.

## Day 77 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 10 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 16th May_

### Today's progress:

- I listened to a talk by Stuart Langridge who shared tips on how to be a better developer.
- Learnt about the different relationships between database tables and ERD's.
- Practised using JOIN in querying a database.

### Thoughts:

Stuart Langridge's talk was very insightful. He shared lots of tips on how to be a better developer and how to get yourself noticed. His advice was to make sure you really understand the basics and practice these fundamentals and learn when to keep things simple and when to use frameworks etc.

We learnt more about relational databases including how to create an Entity Relationship Diagram and how to show the relationships between them. We practised writing more SQL queries and then moved on to writing queries in PostgreSQL. We didn't realise at first that the syntax would be different to SQL.

I also had a session with Naomi after school. This session was our second planning session for our timestable app. We planned out our MVP and each took on some work to complete before our next session.

## Day 78 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 10 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 16th May_

### Today's progress:

- Set up an ElephantSQL account - cloud storage for databases that is optimised for PostgreSQL.
- Spent some time performing CRUD operations on the ElephantSQL platform
- Connected database in VSCode and ran queries directly.

### Thoughts:

I was looking forward to today as I knew it was the day where we would connect the dots and hook up our backend to a database and be able to query it directly. I found the whole task really enjoyable.

I had come across environment variables previously but put this into practice today. We used the dotenv package to manage the loading of environment variables to from a .env file.

I practised writing queries in ElephantSQL but it was really satisfying to set up the client in VSCode and to then perform those CRUD operations from there directly. Looking forward to doing more of this work tomorrow.

## Day 79 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 10 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 16th May_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about parametrised queries and why we need them
- I learnt about the MVC architecture and wrote functions for the models
- I listened to a talk by Dileep Marway and attended a tech meetup in the evening

### Thoughts:

I learnt about how we should never use template literals when writing queries but should use parametrised queries instead. Parametrised queries help us prevent SQL injection attacks that occur when an attacker injects malicious code into input parameters. Writing queries this way also improves performance.

We also learnt about the model, view, controller architecture. This helps us maintain separation of concerns and helps to make our code easier to read, to reuse and to test. It provides a structured and organised approach and allows developers to collaborate simultaneously on different parts of the application without interfering with each other.

We did quite well writing the functions for the models. Once we were familiar with the file structure we found that it wasn't as complicated as we initially thought it may be. We didn't manage to finish so I will be coming back to this over the weekend.

## Day 80 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 10 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 19th May_

### Today's progress:

- All day workshop delivered by Georgina Martin & Asmaa Damoh from couchbase on noSQL DBs
- Created database/cluster, connected to it via Node and performed CRUD operations which we tested in Postman
- After hours session with Sam on PokeDeck - worked on our own branches to add a new feature and a nav bar

### Thoughts:

No hackathon today. Instead we had a workshop delivered by Couchbase on how to use their product. Specifically creating an instance hosted by AWS. We then populated it with data and connected to it via Node. We then added the functions needed to query the database and tested these using Postman.

After the School of Code day was over, Sam and I got together to work on PokeDeck. We realised we were in a good position to now work separately on our own branches. I worked on the popup that should display when clicking on a Pokemon card. I decided to work on making something display and not worry about the content as of yet. By the end of the session I had a working popup which I was very pleased with. The plan is to add to it over the weekend.

## Day 81 & 82 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 10 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Saturday 20th May & Sunday 21st May_

### Today's progress:

- Completed a level 5 codewars kata
- Worked on PokeDeck app
- Finished coding out the query functions for the models from Thursdays workshop and looked more into the MVC Express API pattern

### Thoughts:

Building on Friday's session with Sam, I continued working on the PokeDeck app and the popup that appears when you click on a card. I have it working so that a the same card loads in the popup as well as some other information pulled from the API. One question that I'm hoping to ask my mentor Simon will be how do I then pass this state to a page and not a component. I may be over thinking this and it may be that I don't have to but I will play around with the code and try and figure out a way.

I finished up the main section of Thursday's workshop. I also looked into the MVC architecture a little more so that I had a better understanding of what is happening.

I also spent time working on my LinkedIn profile and tidying my CV up some more even though I submitted the first draft on Friday.

## Day 83 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 11 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 22nd May_

### Today's progress:

- Listened to a talk today on the process of software development at Talis
- I learnt about authentication, authorisation, cookies, session IDs and JWX
- Began a workshop building authentication using Supabase

### Thoughts:

The talk today was really interesting as it gave a really good insight into the process Talis goes through when developing software. They shared a link to their handbook that I found useful as it not only had guidelines but links to further sites and resources.

We also learnt about the difference between authentication and authorisation. Authentication asks 'who are you?' authorisation asks 'What are you allowed to do?'. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the browser and session IDs are unique identifiers generated by a server. JWT - JSON Web Tokens are commonly used for authentication in web apps.

In the late afternoon we began a workshop on authentication using Supabase. We will continue working on this tomorrow.

## Day 84 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 11 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 23rd May_

### Today's progress:

- Listened to a talk by Rik Marselis on writing quality code with a focus on testing
- Continued with yesterday's workshop on authentication in Supabase
- Started making our own todo list app connected to a database with a login

### Thoughts:

Rik Marselis's talk was really interesting as he told us about quality engineering and what that can mean. He talk about tests and the different types. I learnt about boundary testing and exploratory testing as well as some others. I asked whether he had any advice for us on how to implement testing into our 4 week project and he shared a template used for planning out tests. I hope this is something we can use going into our projects.

We continued with our Supabase workshop. We added a logout button and then added more by allowing a user to type in a list of todos. We created a table on Supabase to store these and then granted the user authorisation to create, read, update and delete items from a list. At the moment it was universal authorisation so we would need to change that so that it would only be for that specific user.

## Day 85 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 11 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 24th May_

### Today's progress:

- Great talk by Dr. Murray Hoggett today on general advice and things to expect when applying for jobs
- Intro to TypeScript and a workshop
- Worked with Naomi on Mathswiz after hours

### Thoughts:

Today's talk was really motivating. Dr. Murray was incredibly frank and honest about pay and things he has learned the hard way.

TypeScript - built on JavaScript but is statically typed. We played around with variables using type inference as well as explicitly providing a type. We practised with functions as well as creating new types. We then went on to convert a rock/paper/scissors game written in JS to TypeScript.

After SoC I worked on MathsWiz with Naomi. I finished the wireframe and component tree. We set up the React app with Vite and are ready to branch off and start coding.

## Day 86 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 11 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 25th May_

### Today's progress:

- Another great talk, this time by Amelia Collins-Patel. She shared insights into life after SoC and answered our questions. 
- We dug more into TypeScript and how it works within React. 
- We migrated a game built in React and JS to to TypeScript.

### Thoughts:

We began the day with some codewars and then listened to the talk by Amelia. She shared lots of useful info and advice. 

In the afternoon we worked on TypeScript but with React. We learnt about how to pass props. We then worked on migrating JavaScript files to TypeScript for a todo list app. Once we got the hang of how to type functions, it was pretty straightforward. 

I also worked some more on PokeDeck. I am having some trouble understanding how to reuse the popup component that appears on the home page. I need to make the same popup appear after a user uses the input to search for a specific Pokemon and then clicks on a card. What I have tried so far has not worked so I am just taking my time and trying to understand how it could work or whether I should create another popup component. I need to understand how to pass state/props down when navigating.

## Day 87 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 11 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 26th May_

### Today's progress:

HACKATHON

- Fetched data from a weather API and built a front-end app in TypeScript and React, to display it
- Took time to read and understand code written by others
- Worked on PokeDeck after hours with Sam

### Thoughts:

Today's task was to build an app using TypeScript and React that allowed a user to type in the name of a city and displayed weather data for that city. I worked on it in the morning with my team but missed the middle of the day as I took my dad to an appointment. When I came back, I spent some time reading and understanding the code that David and Roberto had written.

I met up with Sam after to discuss where we are with PokeDeck and what we are going to do over the next week. We split some tasks up and decided that next week we would start on the back-end and do that together initially. 

I also found a solution to the problem I was having with the popup. I realised tha although it is great to be able to reuse components, sometimes it is too complicated and doesn't make sense. I decided instead that when a user clicks on a card they have searched for, it will navigate to a new page that then displays some information about that Pokemon.

## Day 88-90 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 27th May, Sunday 28th May, Monday 29th May_

### Today's progress:

- I worked on Friday's hackathon
- I did research and planned out how to add a back-end to the PokeDeck app
- I read more about accessibility and went through the PokeDeck codebase and refactored where necessary to ensure the app is accessible


### Thoughts:

I tried to make sure that I didn't do too much over this bank holiday weekend as I know with our final projects coming up that the workload will inevitably intensify. Something that I felt would be important to do before the project gets started was to go over the hackathon and make sure I understood the code. I'm glad I did this as I'm not sure I would have time to go back to TypeScript during the project and I wanted to make sure I understood the fundamentals.

Sam and I have given ourselves this week to start adding a back-end to the PokeDeck app. I was still unclear on how we would go about doing that so I did lots of reading and research and made a plan that we can follow when we work together. I'm not sure it covers everything but it definitely helped me to visualise better how to go about doing this. I also went back over the code to make sure we were following accessibility guidelines. It was mostly ok but I found there were some tags that needed updating so that they had more semantic meaning.

## Day 91 of 100 Days Of Code

## Week 12 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 30th May_

### Today's progress:

- Met the new team for the final project
- Created a team manifesto
- Brainstormed app ideas for problems we could solve

### Thoughts:

Today was the first day of our final project month. We are put into teams of 6 and today was just about getting to know each other and creating a team manifesto that will guide us during our time working together. We spent a large portion of today getting to know each other, discussing our working styles and how we would like to work together. This is really important as it will ensure that we are able to work as a cohesive unit and that we enjoy the time we spend together. We discussed ideas for apps based on problems we could solve. We came up with quite a few suggestions and then narrowed it down to a final list. We then used dot voting and found ourselves settling on one idea. The plan for tomorrow is to explore that idea further and try and poke holes in it to see if it stands up.
