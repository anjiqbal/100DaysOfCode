# 100 Days Of Code / School of Code Bootcamp 14.0 Diary

## Day 13 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp


_Monday 13th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about computational thinking and problem solving as key skills - just as important (if not more!) than knowing how to code.
- I learnt about agile ways of developing and the importance of early feedback.
- I spent some time at then end of the day going over today's notesas well as anki review.
- Completed a codewars challenge.

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code
My codewars challenge was to search an array for smiley faces and return a count. As time was an issue, I hardcoded the passable smiley faces in. Given more time, I would have coded a more modular solution where it would be easy to make changes.

#### School of Code
I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of cohort 14 with The School of Code. I plan on making the absolute most of it and doing everything I can to be successful. A massive part of that will be ensuring I manage my time effectively and remembering that it is a marathon not a sprint. I can't wait to see what the rest of the bootcamp and 100 days of code bring.

## Day 14 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp


_Tuesday 14th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt more about computational thinking - decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithms.
- I worked on a login and more or less game with my pair programming partner in scratch. 
- I applied the concepts we learnt and a more systematic approach to my codewars challenge in the evening. 

### Thoughts:

#### 100 days of code
The more rigorous, systematic way of breaking down the codewars problem was really useful. I struggled at first but once I began, it became easier. The pseudocode I ended up writing was really helpful when I eventually went to code the solution.

#### School of Code
I'm enjoying working with my partner for the week, Bernard Molyneux. The process of sharing ideas and articulating my thoughts has already been incredibly valuable to me and I feel myself gaining confidence. 
The approach to problem solving and making sure you really understand what it is that you are trying to solve is surprisingly challenging but is obviously very neccessary. I realise now that while I thought I had a systematic approach to finding solutions, actually I was still rushing in to code

## Day 15 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 15th March_

### Today's progress:

- Started learning JavaScript with SoC today. As I have covered these topics in my personal learning prior to the bootcamp, it served as useful refresher. 
- I got more familiar with Git and GitHub today. 
- Working as part of a team is getting easier, still some technical challenges to overcome, mainly related to GitHub

### Thoughts:

Covered variables, loops and functions today with SoC which was a good reminder of the foundations. I found talking a team member through a workshop activity especially useful as it made me slow down, really think about what was required and then articulate that in a way that was understandable.
Today's Codewars challenge was something I had come across before so I was able to apply that previous knowledge to today's problem.

## Day 16 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 16th March_

### Today's progress:

- Revised objects, creating objects and accessing properties using dot notation and square brackets
- Revised arrays, creating arrays, nested arrays, arrays of objects and looping over arrays 
- Used git and github to successfully share files with my partner and worl collaboratively to complete the tasks assigned in the workshop. We has some time leftover so we played around with some array methods

### Thoughts:

SoC morning session covered the importance of giving and receiving feedback and how valubable it is for growth. I found this session interesting as it made me think about how I give feedback and reminded me that the goal is not to expect someone to change. It also reminded me that receiving feedback is an opportunity for growth.

Today's codewars kata was on the topic of manipulating a number using array methods to expand it e.g. 306 -> '300 + 6'
My first approach did not work as expected as I used the array method map() which was not skipping over the zeroes as I expected but instead 
returning undefined. I then used to filter() to remove the zeroes but this also presented a probelem as the index was important because of place value.

I then realised I was over thinking this problem and realised I could use a simple forEach to skip over the zeroes and push the manipulated number to another array

## Day 17 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 1 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 17th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about clean coding from my mentor - code should read like a story and be understandable for others. I also learnt about 'failing first' which is a way of adding test conditions in your function that eliminate pointless running of code.
- Participated in a hackathon where we pair programmed a game of rock, paper scissors.
- We presented our project and code to other teams and talked them through our thinking and steps.

### Thoughts:

Today's mentor meeting was incredibly informative. I learnt a lot about how to go about breaking problems down and making plans, and what that means in a practical sense. It means that other people can read your code and undrestand what it is that you are doing and what it is that you are trying to do. This is especially important within teams where people can move from project to project multiple times - even in one day.

The hackathon involved creating a game of rock paper scissors. We managed to complete most of it. The key lesson I learnt was on collaborating with others and working together throught making a plan, pair programming and sharing via GitHub.

## Day 18 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 18th March_

### Today's progress:

- Applied what I learnt about problem solving over the past week to solve a level 5 Codewars kata. 
- Did some reading around ChatGPT and the best way to use this tool.
- Forked project hackathon repo and refactored the code

### Thoughts:

As I had more time today I decided to attempt a level 5 kata and appproach it in the way that SoC have taught over the past week. I made a thorough plan and broke each section down. When unsure I put in what I thought a possible appraoch may be. I found that breaking everything down in such detail made the parts I understood far more straightforward to code. With the parts that I didn't understand, it was easy to see what I needed to search for.

<img src='https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/18-3-2023-plan.svg' />

I also worked on refactoring the code from the hackathon yesterday. A really useful task as I looked for patterns and was able to tidy up the code. I made sure each action was done by one function and created a function that controlled the game.

## Day 19 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 19th March_

### Today's progress:

- Completed codewars challenge on strings and arrays
- Spent some time reviewing array and string methods
- Did some reading and watched a video om chatGPT and the best way to use it as a tool

### Thoughts:

Today's codewars challenge was straight forward. I still made a plan and noticed that I picked up on potential mistakes I would have made while coding.

<img src="https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/mexican-wave1.svg" />

I then spent some time looking at the code to see if I could improve it. I realised that I did not need the if statement. I removed it and the code was still functioning as it should.

<img src="https://github.com/anjiqbal/100DaysOfCode/blob/main/images/wave2.svg" />

I learnt that chatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool but can also be dangerous for learners and early career level developers. It can be useful to generate questions to practice your skills and check syntax etc. Doing more complicated actions with it can be risky if you do not have the understanding and experience of your programming language at a deeper level.

## Day 20 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 20th March_

### Today's progress:

- Today I learnt that the DOM (Document Object Model) takes our static HTML and makes it into an object that we can manipulate.
- I learnt how to select elements, how to manipulate the text content of selected elements, how to append elements to the DOM, how to loop through a NodeList and how to remove elements.
- I did some background reading to further understand the DOM and how to manipulate it.

### Thoughts:

We covered a lot today regarding the DOM and how to manipulate it. I found it incredibly useful to be able to work through the assigned tasks in a group as we could discuss and plan together and then tackle the tasks. I found it useful to research how to use certain methods, for example removeChild.

Today's codewars challenge was regarding manipulating strings. Part of the challenge was to leave certain words lowercase. These words were passed in as a string as the second argument. However this argument was optional. Initilaly, when this second argument was not passed, I was getting errrors. I realised that I could overcome these errors by setting the default value of that parameter as an empty string instead of using if statements to check.
 ```
 function titleCase(title, minorWords = '')
 
 ```

## Day 21 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 21th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learned about events in JavaScript and the event object and some of its properties and values
- I learned about event listeners and the different types of events they can be called on
- I learned about how to incorporate AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot into my learning - to use them but ensure that we understand exactly what the code is doing

### Thoughts:

Before bootcamp started today, I completed a codewars challenge adding a new method to the String prototype. I also watched a video on writing clean, concise code by Christopher Miller.

In our teams we worked on adding event listeners to a site to carry out actions on various events such as click, mouse enter or keyup. I also explored the event object in the console and was able to use some of what I discovered to perform different actions.

I also learned about AI tools and how powerful they can be but also how we should carefully approach the code that is written for us. We asked ChatGPT to generate the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code for a basic rock, paper, scissors game. I found that there were errors in the code that needed debugging, however the very basic game did eventually work. I refactored the code to remove the onclick event listener from the HTML and instead added event listeners to the JavaScript file. I found the more precise I was in my language with Github Copilot the more useful the code was for my intended purpose.

## Day 22 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 22th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt about asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript and the async methods setTimeout() and setInterval as well as the event loop.
- I learnt about API's and how to use the fetch method to send a GET request.
- I applied everything I learnt to send a GET request to cat fact API. I used event listeners to make the page dynamic. 

### Thoughts:

Codewars had me stumped for a while this morning but I realised after putting some console logs that my map method was resetting my count to 1 each time it was running despite me thinking it was being updated.

JavaScript is single-threaded but asynchronous functions allow it to behave like it is multi-threaded and non-blocking.  The event loop organises the order in which code is executed. 

API's can be accessed using the fetch method. Fetch is asynchronous and returns a promise. We need to wait for the promise to resolve or reject before we can do anything with it. Using the async keyword before the function and then await within the function allows us to wait for the promise to resolve withoult blocking the rest of the code.

## Day 23 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Thursday 23th March_

### Today's progress:

- Did some research on Chrome's dev tools and came together and presented what we discovered to everyone.
- Learnt about UI/UX principles - the most important takeaway being "Don't make users think"
- Used destructuring assignment and object methods to solve a coding challenge.

### Thoughts:

After solving a codewars challenge on my own this morning, I was also able to spend some time solving some problems together in our team. It's a useful way of troubleshooting and I find thinking out loud with others is helping me to cement ideas and language into my understanding.

Also spent some time planning out an app that will allow users to practice times tables. I managed to code a basic structure and will add to it over the coming few days.

## Day 24 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 2 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Friday 24th March_

### Today's progress:

- Researched APIs as a team, chose one and made a plan for what to build.
- Used the fetch method as well as async and await to get data from the API and ectracted what we needed.
- Built a simple web app that takes user input and responds with data from the API.

### Thoughts:

Today was hackathon day. We were tasked to explore a few APIs, select one and create an app. We spent a decent amount of time ensuring that we had the foundations of an app that we could then build further features on, time permitting. We decided to go with a dad joke API and to set the page up as a text based conversation. Ultimately, we found that the JavaScript was mostly straightforward, it was the CSS that caused us problems. 

We struggled at first to align the elements as if it was a conversation. We were mostly able to overcome this by lots of research and working together. It made me realise that I could definitely do with some more CSS practice.

## Day 25 of 100 Days Of Code

_Saturday 25th March_

### Today's progress:

- Completed codewars challenge on the topic of arrays and adding methods to the prototype
- Revised all the content covered so far by SoC
- Read around the topic of UI/UX in preparation for next week

### Thoughts:

Today was a busy day so I didnt't manage to get as much coding done as I would have liked. 

I completed a codewars challenge that involved adding methods to the Array prototype. Allowed me to get some more understanding of the this keyword.

I spent some time revising all the topics covered so far by SoC - objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, APIs, async/sync functions and event listeners.

## Day 26 of 100 Days Of Code

_Sunday 26th March_

### Today's progress:

- Completed codewars challenge on the topic of objects, getters and setters
- Spent some time creating a simple cat image app using an API with event listeners
- Created a simple to-do list app that takes in a task and a number and displays tasks by priorities

### Thoughts:

Today's codewars challenge was involved creating a function that returned an object with getter and setter methods. I couldn't get it to work at first but I realised quickly that the error was in the setter method where I wasn't assigning the argument to the variable.

I enjoyed completing the homework tasks today. The to-do list was the most challenging. Organising the tasks by priority was tricky at first. I needed to remove the list as it was on the page. I found this was done by setting the innerHTML property to an empty string. The next task was to sort the items by priority. I used the sort method to sort the array by lowest to highest priority. I then looped over the array of items and reused a function to add the list items by priority.

Given more time, I plan on adding styles as well as some more functionality. I would like to add the ability to remove items and sort the priorities as a new item is added.

## Day 27 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Monday 27th March_

### Today's progress:

- I learnt more about the benefits of developing software with an agile methodology
- I learnt a little about what a site reliability engineer (SRE) does from Dave Adams. 
- I spent some time on CSSGrid and Flexbox, and added further functionality to rock/paper/scissors game.

### Thoughts:

I learnt more about the agile methodology, it's core values and a little of the history and how it first came about. I did some further reseearch on the Atlassian website. I think fundamentally it is a process that involves understanding, collaborating, learning and staying flexible and gives you the ability to deliver value to customers far quicker.

I spent some time working on a previous project - rps game. I added further functionality to it by allowing the user to pick 3/5/7 games, the winner being the one who wins the most. I applied what I learnt today on CSSGrid and Flexbox to the styling of the game.

## Day 28 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Tuesday 28th March_

### Today's progress:

- Spent a lot of time today looking at UX - user experience. More specifically the five stages of design.
- Spent more time working on RPS game - added score tracker and worked on CSS
- Challenging Codewars kata today, involving taking in a string of names and returning a string sorted alphabetically and in a specific format.

### Thoughts:

Not much coding today with SoC as we covered UX and the design process. I found it interesting how it is also a very iterative process similar to the agile methodology. I learnt a lot about how design should be user centered but of course keeping business needs in mind.

My Codewars challenge today was really fun as it really stretched my understanding of the sort method for arrays. I also used destructured assignment to split out the names in the string. I had to play around with the sort method and what it returned in order to get the correct sorting of names. I then refactored the code and split some of the things into separate functions.

## Day 29 of 100 Days Of Code
## Week 3 - School of Code Bootcamp

_Wednesday 29th March_

### Today's progress:

- Focus on UI - accessibility, lighthouse audits ac colour theory were just some of the topics we covered
- I learnt how to make a wireframe using Figma and why wireframes are necessary
- I learnt more about CSS, specifically the way our CSS should be organised

### Thoughts:

I found the discussions around accessiblity very interesting today. The lighthouse audit is a very useful tool to not only see how your webiste performs but alos how accessible it is. 

I need to spend more time on Figma and practice how to build a wireframe. I feel it will be a really useful tool to help me build my own projects.

I had a lot of fun attempting to build a BBC clone today in HTML and CSS. I didn't have as much time as I would have like so will be coming back to it on the weekend hopefully. It was a really useful exercise as it helped me to put in to practice what I learnt about Flexbox and CSSGrid.
